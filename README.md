A toolbox to insert pre-written templates in comments on [Blender Community](https://blender.community/#). Because I realised I often had to repeat the same thing and sometimes I did a better job at it than other days. So I started to compile well written and though-out templates I can reuse often.

You can preview all the available templates in [BCom-Toolbox/templates.md](https://github.com/L0Lock/BCom-Toolbox/blob/main/templates.md)

## Usage

Toggle the toolbox on/off by clicking the ðŸ’¬ button.

Templates are searchable. Clicking a template copies it on your clipboard, you are then in control of where to insert it in your comment, and modify it to your liking.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please be aware that these really are just templates. Don't use them as monolithical comments. Instead, use them as a base guide to write tailored comments better and faster. We wouldn't want to be a community of robots exchanging only in prefabs, right? ðŸ˜‰

## Installation

1. You need a userscript extension installed on your web browser:
    - Firefox: Â Â [Greasemonkey â€“ Get this Extension for ðŸ¦Š Firefox (en-US)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
    - Chrome: [Tampermonkey - Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
2. Open the raw [BCon-Toolbox.user.js](https://github.com/L0Lock/BCom-Toolbox/raw/refs/heads/main/BCon-Toolbox.user.js), your userscript extension should detect it and propose you to install it.  
    If not, copy the whole code and refer to your extension's tools to add a script manually.
  

## Contribute new messages

New messages have to be written in Markdown, as supported on blender.community. There isn't an official guide of its supported Markdown, but I invite you to read [Basic writing and formatting syntax - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) which is a standard Markdown and mostly supported on BC.

Each message is made of a descriptive title (which you see in **bold** in the search result) and a body which is what will actually be inserted.

You can send templates proposition in two ways: 

1. Post a [Template Proposal](https://github.com/L0Lock/BCom-Toolbox/issues/new?assignees=L0Lock&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=template-proposal.md&title=%5BTemplate%5D+your+new+template), adapted for regular users and to propose a single template
    - Follow the template proposal prefill: describe the proposal, post the code twice so that we can see both raw code and final preview.
2. Fork the repository and send a pull request: adapted to send multiple templates at once and for advanced users who know how to use git.
    - Fork the repo and open [templates.md](https://github.com/L0Lock/BCom-Toolbox/raw/refs/heads/main/templates.md).
    - Add your new template  ideally sorter alphabetically with the others.
    - Send your update via pull request, **with a detailed explanation of the changes and why**.
    - If I accept it, I will trigger the json regeneration with the [Update Templates JSON](https://github.com/L0Lock/BCom-Toolbox/actions/workflows/add_template.yml) Github Action.
