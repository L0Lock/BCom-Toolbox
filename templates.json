    "body": "Proposals like \"make it better, faster, or use a better algorithm\" don’t provide actionable information for developers. They’re already committed to improving Blender's performance and features, but without specifics, such posts offer no guidance on **what** to improve or **how** to do it.\n\nDevelopers need concrete, real-world examples of issues:\n\n- What is slow or inefficient?\n- What specific tools, workflows, or processes are problematic?\n- How does it impact your projects or goals?\n\nFor example, instead of saying 'faster simulation,' describe a scenario: 'Fluid simulations with high viscosity take excessively long on 4K meshes; optimizing this could save hours during iterations.'\n\nIf you can’t pinpoint the issue or solution, it’s better to seek community feedback or provide detailed examples rather than post vague requests."
